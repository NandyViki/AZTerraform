1) select the provider - here its azure hence we begin with writing the provider
block with our tenant and subscription details.

2)create a resource group

3) create a vnet with desired cidr

4) create a subnet with desired cidr

5) create NIC and ensure to have public_ip_address_id field in this so that we can
return the id of the pip function here. this ensures the nic is attached to the pip we
create.

6)create pip

7)create a NSG. To ensure this NSG is attached to our NIC created in Step 5, we need to 
add this module :

resource "azurerm_network_interface_security_group_association" "example" {
  network_interface_id      = azurerm_network_interface.example.id
  network_security_group_id = azurerm_network_security_group.example.id
}

8)Finally, create the VM. Its here we attach the NIC module's id so that the VM and NIC we created
  in Step 5 are associated.
